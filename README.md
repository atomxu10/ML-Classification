# Analysis of Different Machine Learning Models in Classification![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-R-blue)
With the development of imaging technology, high-energy gamma particles can be recorded in the ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov gamma telescope. The particle streams can be distinguished from gamma and hadron streams due to different shower images (Bock et al., 2004). In this project, I will use different models for the classification problem to effectively distinguish between gamma particle (g) and hadron (h). then I will compare the prediction accuracy of different methods, choose a model that performs best, and predict the accuracy on the test set based on optimizing the model of that method. All corresponding codes (R Markdown) can be found in the xxxxxxx

## Data
The data set is generated by simulation of the data collected by the atmospheric Cherenkov telescope (UCI Machine Learning Repository: MAGIC Gamma Telescope Data Set, 2022), which is a multivariate data set divided into 10 continuous variables (Length, Width, Size, Conc, Conc1, Asym, M3long, M3Trans, Alpha, Dist), and one categorical variable (g means the gamma particle and h means the hadron). The details of the variables can be found at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/magic+gamma+telescope. In this project, several variables are available for our discussion of the classification problem. 

75% of the data are randomly selected as the training set and the remaining 25% as the testing set after setting up the seed. The performance of different models is to be checked, so the same test set and training set are used. After getting different models, the roc curve (receiver operating characteristic curve) is introduced to check the classification performance, the confusion matrix will be introduced to calculate the accuracy of the test set, and the best model applicable to this data set will be obtained by comparing the accuracy of different classifiers.
