# Analysis of Different Machine Learning Models in Classification  ![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-R-blue)
With the development of imaging technology, high-energy gamma particles can be recorded in the ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov gamma telescope. The particle streams can be distinguished from gamma and hadron streams due to different shower images (Bock et al., 2004). In this project, I will use different models for the classification problem to effectively distinguish between gamma particle (g) and hadron (h). then I will compare the prediction accuracy of different methods, choose a model that performs best, and predict the accuracy on the test set based on optimizing the model of that method. All corresponding codes (R Markdown) can be found in the xxxxxxx

## Data
The data set is generated by simulation of the data collected by the atmospheric Cherenkov telescope (UCI Machine Learning Repository: MAGIC Gamma Telescope Data Set, 2022), which is a multivariate data set divided into 10 continuous variables (Length, Width, Size, Conc, Conc1, Asym, M3long, M3Trans, Alpha, Dist), and one categorical variable (g means the gamma particle and h means the hadron). The details of the variables can be found at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/magic+gamma+telescope. In this project, several variables are available for our discussion of the classification problem. 

75% of the data are randomly selected as the training set and the remaining 25% as the testing set after setting up the seed. The performance of different models is to be checked, so the same testing set and training set are used. After getting different models, the roc curve (receiver operating characteristic curve) is introduced to check the classification performance, the confusion matrix will be introduced to calculate the accuracy of the testing set, and the best model applicable to this data set will be obtained by comparing the accuracy of different classifiers.

## Classification techniques

### Logistic regression

Logistic regression is a generalized linear model that belongs to the domain of supervised learning in machine learning. The derivation process and computational methods of logistic regression are similar to those of linear regression. However, logistic regression is specifically designed to address dichotomous classification problems.

To ensure consistency in the logistic regression model, I standardized the predictors individually to mitigate the impact of differing variable weights caused by significant variations in their values. Using 75% of the training samples, the resulting Logistic regression can be expressed as: 

ùëå = 0.372 + 1.556 Length + 0.321 Width + 0.180 Size ‚àí 0.307 Conc + 0.941 Conc1 + 0.014 Asym ‚àí 0.506 M3Long ‚àí 0.08 M3Trans + 1.319 Alpha + 0.078 Dist

In Figure 1, the point marked on the ROC curve is labeled with a threshold value of 0.485. The coordinates of this point are (0.802, 0.756), where 0.802 represents sensitivity and 0.756 represents specificity. The AUC value of 0.851 indicates that the model performs well in distinguishing between the two classes. A higher AUC value generally suggests better model performance. The optimal threshold for the logistic regression model appears to be around 0.485. This threshold provides a balanced trade-off between sensitivity (80.2%) and specificity (75.6%). By using this threshold, the model achieves a prediction accuracy of 78.01% on the testing set.
